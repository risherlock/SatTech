\section{Topology}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Give an example that in a general a family of open sets is not closed under infinite intersections.

  \begin{ans_box}
    Let us consider $\mathbb{R}$ under the metric d$(x,y)=|x-y|$ with open sets $U_{n}=\left(-\dfrac{1}{n},\dfrac{1}{n}\right)$.
    $$
    \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}U_{n}=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(-\dfrac{1}{n},\dfrac{1}{n}\right)=\{0\}
    $$

  Intersection of the open sets $U_{n}$ becomes narrower with increase in $n$ and approaches $\{0\}$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.\medskip

  We know that a subset $U\subset\mathbb{R}$ is said to be open if, for every point $x\in U$, there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that the open ball $B(x,\varepsilon)=\{y\in\mathbb{R}\,|\,\text{d}(x,y)<\varepsilon\}$. We cannot create such open ball within a singleton $\{0\}$. Therefore $U_{n}$ is not closed under infinite intersection.
  \end{ans_box}

  \item Give an example that a bijective continuous function $f:E\rightarrow F$ between topological spaces is not necessarily a homeomorphism.

  \begin{ans_box}
    Let us consider that $E=\mathbb{R}$ has the standard topology generated by open intervals and $F=\mathbb{R}$ has the lower limit topology generated by basis of half-open intervals $[a,b)$ for $a<b$ where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$. Furthermore, we define the function $f:E\rightarrow F$ as identity map i.e. $f(x)=x$.\medskip

  $f$, being an identity map, is clearly a bijection and also continuous because open sets in $E$ is also an open set in $F$. However, $f^{-1}:F\rightarrow E$ is not continuous because not every pre-image of open sets in $F$ is an open set in $E$ under $f$. For example, $[0,1)\in F$ is not an open set in $E$.
  \end{ans_box}

  \item Give an example of connected topological space which is not path connected.

  \begin{ans_box}
    Consider
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{split}
        Y&=\{(0,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}|y\in[-1,1]\},\\
        Z&=\{(x,\sin\frac{\pi}{x})\in\mathbb{R}^{2}|x\in(0,1]\}, \text{ and}\\
        X&=Y\cup Z.
      \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Euclidean topology is induced on $X$ by inclusion on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. \medskip

    $Z$ is connected space because it is an image of connected set $(0,1]$ under continuous sine function. $X$ is closure of $Z$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ which makes $X$ a connected space. \medskip

    Let $\gamma:[0,1]\mapsto X$ be a path in $X$ that begins at $y\in Y$ and ends at $z\in Z$ with $\gamma(0)=y$ and $\gamma(1)=z$. Existence of such a map $\gamma$ would make $X$ a path-connected space. This can be contradicted if we show that $\gamma([0,1])\subseteq Y$ i.e. path is confined to $Y$.\medskip

    $\gamma^{-1}(Y)$ is certainly nonempty as it contains at least one element i.e. $0$. Suppose $t\in\gamma^{-1}(Y)$ and $\varepsilon>0$ with a value which ensure $\gamma\left((t-\varepsilon,\,t+\varepsilon)\right)$ is contained in a closed disc $D$ centered at $\gamma(t)$ and radius $r$. The intersection of this disc with $X$ consists of two intervals; i) closed interval in $Y$ and ii) closed segment of curve in $Z$ i.e. $$D\cup X=(D\cap Y)\cup(D\cap Z).$$

    We know that $(D\cap Y)\cap(D\cap Z)=\emptyset$, therefore $(D\cap Y)$ and $(D\cap Z)$ are separated from one another. Since $\gamma(t)\in D\cap Y$ and $(t-\varepsilon,\,t+\varepsilon)$ is connected, the image should be connected as well. This forces all the elements of $\gamma\left((t-\varepsilon,\,t+\varepsilon)\right)$ to be in $(D\cap Y)$ which implies $\gamma([0,1])\subseteq Y$.
  \end{ans_box}

\item  Give an example of a connected topological space which is not locally connected.

\begin{ans_box}
  Let us take connected space $X$ in above exercise. To show that $X$ is not locally connected, we have to find at least a point in $p\in X$ that does not contain a connected open neighborhood.

  Suppose an open disc centered on $p=(0,1)\in Y\in X$ with radius $r$. Since $Y$ is a closed set and $p$ is the edge of the line, there is no open connected open neighborhood of $p$.
\end{ans_box}

\item Recall the

  \textbf{Definition.} A topological space $X$ is \textit{totally disconnected} if the connected components of $X$ are single points.

  Give an example of a totally disconnected topological space.

  \begin{ans_box}
    Suppose $A=\{x\in\mathbb{Q}|x<\sqrt{2}\}=(-\infty,\sqrt{2})\cap\mathbb{Q}$ where the open segment $(-\infty,\sqrt{2})\in\mathbb{R}$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ so $A$ is open in the subspace topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. Similarly $B=\{x\in\mathbb{Q}|x>\sqrt{2}\}=(\sqrt{2},+\infty,)\cap\mathbb{Q}$ is open in $\mathbb{Q}$ too. These open sets are disjoint and their union is $\mathbb{Q}$, therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ is not connected.\medskip

  Between any two rational numbers there exists an irrational number. Therefore $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$ belong to different components of $\mathbb{Q}$. Indeed the components of $\mathbb{Q}$ are  singletons which, by definition, implies that $\mathbb{Q}$ is totally disconnected.
  \end{ans_box}
  \item Recall the

  \textbf{Definition.} Let $X$ be a topological space. A subset $S\subset X$ is said to be \textit{dense} in $X$ if, for each $x\in X$ and each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a point $s\in S$ s.t. $s\in U$.

  Give an example of a dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ (with usual topology.)

  \item Let $X$ be the space of continuous functions on the interval $I:=[0,1]$. Show that $$\text{d}(f,g):=\max_{x\in I}|f(x)-g(x)|$$ defines a metric on $X$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Differential calculus}

\begin{enumerate}[start=9]
  \item Add to your personal mathematical tool box the following
  \paragraph{Definition.}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $E$ be a normed space and $f:U\subset E\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable so that D$f(u)\in L(E,\mathbb{R})=E^{*}$. In this case we sometimes write d$f(u)$ for D$f(u)$ and call d$f$ the \textit{differential} of $f$. Thus $\text{d}f:U\rightarrow E^{*}$.

    \begin{ans_box}
      \textit{What does it mean to compute derivative of real-valued function $f$ evaluated at point $u$? What kind of object is it?}\medskip

      It is a linear map from the normed space to the field $\mathbb{R}$. A linear map being scalar-valued suggests that $f$ is a \textit{linear functional}, also known as \textit{covecter}, that belongs to the \textit{dual space} of the normed space. Dual space, by definition, is the set of linear functionals.\medskip

      $E$ in real vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is usually considered as a set of column vectors, whereas an element in its dual space is a row vector. Row vector acting on a column vector gives us scalar in the field. This operation is not to be confused with inner products because inner products are defined on space and dual space is not involved. However, it is to be noted that finite dimensional real vector spaces and their dual spaces are isomorphic.\medskip

      Usually in differential geometry we forget about partial derivatives because if a normed vector space is a matrix space (matrix spaces are vector spaces), then we go into trouble if we want to compute partial derivatives as we have two indices of matrix to take care of. $\text{d}f$ is called differential of $f$ which is different from the differential of a function evaluated a point $u$ i.e. $\text{d}f(u)$. $\text{d}f(u)$, by definition, is a linear mapping that one can apply to a direction defined by an element on the domain. This linear functional act on $E$, therefore we can apply it to the element of $E$. This is expressed as $$\text{d}f(u):h\rightarrow \text{d}f(u)h\quad\text{ where }h\in E.$$

      $\text{d}f(u)$ is a linear map that maps a direction to a the directional derivative. It must be noted that $\text{d}f$, the differential of $f$, certainly not linear. If we have nonlinear function, the derivative of differential is not linear.\medskip

      $\text{d}f$ is a mapping which one can evaluate on a open subset $U$ of normed space to the dual of the space. It is an important concept and we should always try to question, \textit{"What kind of mapping is it?"} when thinking about derivatives.
    \end{ans_box}

    \item Let $(E, \langle.,.\rangle)$ be a Hilbert space and $f:U\subset E\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable. The \textit{gradient} of $f$ is the map grad$f=\nabla f:U\rightarrow E$ defined (implicitly) by $\langle\nabla f(u), e\rangle:=\text{d}f(u)\cdot e$, meaning the linear map d$f(u)$ applied to the vector $e$ (directional derivative).

    \begin{ans_box}
      $f$ is real-valued and differential as before, but with added structure.
    \end{ans_box}
  \end{enumerate}

  \item

  \item Endow the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ (matrix space) with the inner product $\langle A,B\rangle:=\text{tr}(A^{\top}B)$. Consider the smooth function $f:\text{GL}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by $X\mapsto\text{tr}(X^{-1})$ and compute grad$f(X)$. (

  {\footnotesize Hint: Do not even try to work with partial derivatives.}

  \item For $g:\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, defined by $X\mapsto X^{3}$, for $H\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, compute the directional derivative D$g(X)\cdot H$.

  {\footnotesize Hint: Ditto.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Smooth manifolds}

  \item
  \item
  \item \label{item:16} Show that the set GL$_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ of real invertible $n\times n$ matrices is a differentiable manifold.

  \item Similar to Exercise \ref{item:16} show that the set $\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}_{*}$, i.e., the set of all full rank real rectangular matrices with $n\leq m$ forms a $nm$-dimensional submanifold of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\cong\mathbb{R}^{nm}$.
\end{enumerate}

    $$

    \item Which of the points
    $p\in\left\{\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1/3\\1/3\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-1/3\\-1/3\end{bmatrix}\right\}$

  $$

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the tangent map T$f_{\theta}$ via the algebraic approach.

    {\footnotesize Hint: It may be easier to proceed by first identifying $\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}\cong\mathbb{R}^{4}$ in a suitable way, but one certainly can go ahead without doing so, as well.}

    \item Compute $Tf_{\theta}V$ with
    $$
    V:=\cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+
    \cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial z}-\cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial t}.
    $$
